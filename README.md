## Description

This is a fun math quiz designed for children. The python application recognizes digits from real time webcam data. The user is allowed to write the digits on the screen using an object-of-interest (a blue water bottle cap in this case).

We use tkinter to design a simple UI. For digit recognition, we train a CNN on the MNIST dataset.
